# Audio3D module
BlitzMax module that adds 3D positional sound system to Openb3d

## Requirements
This module is included with the Openb3dex module. Additionaly it requires the BRL.Audio module. It can easily be modified for use as a regular import or include file.

## Installation 
Click on the Github Download zip link and extract to your `BlitzMax/mod/` folder. Remove **-master** from the main **openb3dex.mod-master** folder. Then in the BlitzMax IDE choose "Build Modules" from the "Program" menu. After building, chose "Document Modules..." from the Program menu which updates the syntax highlighting for this module.

## Usage
Install the module and add `Import Openb3dex.Audio3d` to the top of your source, right below `Framework Openb3d.B3dglgraphics`

## Bugs
Currently none known...

## To Do
I would love to add in a world sound system that would handle how objects interact with the sounds (sounds playing on the other side of a house should sound like there's a house in the way...) but I'm not a sound engineer so I think that is probably beyond my capabilities. Though if anyone has any thoughts/info please contact me.
