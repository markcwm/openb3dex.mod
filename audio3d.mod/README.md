# Audio3D module
BlitzMax module that adds 3D positional sound system to Openb3d.

## Requirements
This module is included with the Openb3dmax module. Additionaly it requires the BRL.Audio module. It can easily be modified for use as a regular import or include file.

## Installation 
To install in the BlitzMax IDE choose "Build Modules" from the "Program" menu. After building, it is recommended that you chose "Document Modules..." from the Program menu to build/update the documentation for this module in the help system.

## Usage
Install the module and add "Import Openb3dmax.Audio3d" to the top of your source, right below "Framework Openb3d.B3dglgraphics".

## Bugs
Currently none known...

## To Do
I would love to add in a world sound system that would handle how objects interact with the sounds (sounds playing on the other side of a house should sound like there's a house in the way...) but I'm not a sound engineer so I think that is probably beyond my capabilities. Though if anyone has any thoughts/info please contact me.
