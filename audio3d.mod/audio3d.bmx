bbdoc: 3D sound with Brl.Audio
about: You must stop all sounds associated with an entity before freeing it.
Call #EntityStop3DSound before freeing an entity if there is a chance it could be playing a sound. 
Failure to stop sounds associated with a non-existent entity can cause your program to crash.

If you set any SoundPoint "bump" field to UPDATE_DISABLED then it will no longer be updated and can be
directly modified. For example, setting VolumeBump = UPDATE_DISABLED will stop Volume field from updating.
